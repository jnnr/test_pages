### Test pages

Hello!

This documentation is a test of github pages for project documentation.
Big question:
Will math rendering work?

\\[ x = {-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac} \over 2a} \\]

Yes!
This is the important bit:
Add _layout/default.html according to:
https://help.github.com/articles/customizing-css-and-html-in-your-jekyll-theme/

to tell the theme to include _includes/scripts.html

where you include the mathjax script.
